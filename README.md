# An Embedding CNN model for sentiment analysis

Word embeddings are a technique for representing text where different words with similar meaning have a similar real-valued vector representation. They are a key breakthrough that has led to great performance of neural network models on a suite of challenging natural language processing problems. In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop word embedding models with convolutional neural networks to classify movie reviews. 


## Covering topics like
- How to prepare movie review text data for classification with deep learning methods.
- How to develop a neural classification model with word embedding and convolutional layers.
- How to evaluate the developed a neural classification model.
